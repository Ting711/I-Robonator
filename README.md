# I-Robonator Team, Malaysia
Our team, I-Robonator from Malaysia is a passionate trio dedicated to perfecting the essential components of our self-driving car. We were thrilled to introduce our committed members, Adam Syahmi Bin Mohd Syahrizal, Pui Sin Ru and Raymond Ting Yih Wei. Together, we carefully design and oversee each electronic mechanical part and ensure our self-driving vehicle runs smoothly.

# Performance Video

# 1.0 Mobility Management
This section explains the robot design, vehicle movement management, and the implementation of selected motors. It also provides a brief discussion of the vehicle chassis design and the mounting of all components to the vehicle structure. The discussion includes engineering principles such as speed, torque, and power.

## 1.1 Chasis of Robot
We use a LEGO 32019+86652 tire and differential gear for our robot’s chasis.
 
### 1.1.1 Robot's Tire
The significance of the vehicle’s chassis design lies in providing structural support, ensuring the robot’s stability during dynamic maneuvers such as high-speed turns and sudden accelerations. Specifically, the rear wheels are fitted with tires suitable for the robot's size, helping to enhance stability and speed during operation. Additionally, a differential gear allows for smoother turns, optimizing the robot’s overall performance.
The LEGO 32019+86652 tire combination was chosen because of its unique benefits, which make it ideal for robotics and vehicle projects requiring traction, stability, and operational efficiency. With the 32019 rim and the 86652 tire, this combination delivers a moderate size that fits medium-sized robots or cars perfectly without adding extra mass. Better control is made possible by it which is particularly advantageous for projects constructed in cramped areas.
By decreasing slippage, the tread pattern of the 86652 tire improves grip, which is essential for preserving stability on a variety of surfaces, including uneven terrain and smooth floors. It is also ideal for dynamic movements like sharp twists and abrupt accelerations because of the tight fit between the tire and rim, which guarantees stability even under large loads or high speeds. The possibility of tire slippage or balancing problems is reduced by this sturdy construction.
